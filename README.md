# wtianns
wavetable-inspired artificial neural network synthesizer

this version of wtianns exists as a pd external, [wtianns~]. 

dependencies:
FANN (fast artificial neural network) library
FFTW (fastest fourier transform in the west) library
pure data (pd) is necessary to run the external.

later: keras2c library may be used instead of FANN.

currently unavailable for public: application to analyze audio file, create, and train artificial neural network. instead, you can use an included .net file.
